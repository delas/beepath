The following textual description follows the closed-world assumption, meaning that only the activities specified can be executed in the specified order. Any possible activity and execution that is not specified is considered impossible.
Initially start "I".

(SILENT_G_H): "G" and "H".

After "I" ends, immediately either start "A" or start "B".
After either "A" ends or "B" ends, immediately either start "E" or start "F" or start (SILENT_G_H).
After either "E" ends or "F" ends or (SILENT_G_H) ends, immediately start "X".

After "X" ends, the process finishes.
