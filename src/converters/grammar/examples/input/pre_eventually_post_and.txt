The following textual description follows the closed-world assumption, meaning that only the activities specified can be executed in the specified order. Any possible activity and execution that is not specified is considered impossible.
Initially start "I".

(SILENT_C_D): "C" or "D".

After "I" ends, immediately start "A" and start "B" and start (SILENT_C_D).
After "A" ends and "B" ends and (SILENT_C_D) ends, eventually start "E".

After "E" ends, the process finishes.
